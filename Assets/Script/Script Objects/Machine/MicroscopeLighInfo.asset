  title: Gel Electrophoresis
  descriptionShort: Gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of
    biomacromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) and their fragments, based on their
    size and charge.
  descriptionLong: Gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of
    biomacromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) and their fragments, based on their
    size and charge. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge
    or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular
    biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to
    estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge.
