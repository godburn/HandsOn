  descriptionShort: 'A device that uses centrifugal force to separate various components
    of a fluid. '
  descriptionLong: A device that uses centrifugal force to separate various components
    of a fluid. This is achieved by spinning the fluid at high speed within a container,
    thereby separating fluids of different densities or liquids from solids. It works
    by causing denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction.
    At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and moved to the
    centre. In a laboratory centrifuge that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration
    causes denser particles to settle to the bottom of the tube, while low-density
    substances rise to the top. A centrifuge can be a very effective filter that
    separates contaminants from the main body of fluid.
